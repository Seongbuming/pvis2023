                              Chansoo Kim is a research scientist as well as an economist at the Computational Science Research Center 
                              in Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Republic of Korea. He leads the group 
                              ‘Information Machine Learning Financial Econ Lab’, which works on the science of information and 
                              complex (adaptive) systems.

                              His research focuses on heavy-tailed distributions such as leptokurtic distribution, which are among 
                              the non-Gaussian behaviours, and its applications to learning, reasoning, finance as well as inequality. 
                              One of his research and academic ancestors is C. F. Gauß. He has been working hard to be a good scientist, 
                              who stands under the intellectual tradition of Neruda, Szymborska, Lacan, Levinas, Hirofumi, Keynes, 
                              Mandelbrot, Boulding, Prigogine, Shannon and Boltzmann.

                              For the COVID-19 pandemic, his group has performed a series of macroscale individual-based simulations 
                              for policy development and assessments with the Korean government using parallel computers. He obtained 
                              his B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.A. focusing on Statistical Physics, and his PhD is in Economics 
                              (Mathematical Finance and Machine Learning).

                              Sangbong Yoo received the bachelor's and Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Sejong University, 
                              Seoul, South Korea, in 2015 and 2022, respectively. He is currently a Postdoctral Researcher with Sejong 
                              University. His research interests include gaze analysis, EEG analysis, data quality, data visualization, 
                              visual analytics.

                              Visual Analysis of Gaze Behavior for Understanding Human Visual Attention
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              <br>
                              Since the mechanism of visual attention is an covoert process, overt evidence is crucial to explain this 
                              mechanism. Gaze behavior studies mainly show statistical analysis of eye movements and human visual 
                              attention. Eye movement data are utilized to investigate visual saliency that makes objects stand out and 
                              draw attention. Also, AoIs refers to meaningful areas in visual stimuli for experiment and verification 
                              of research hypotheses. AoI-based visualization shows patterns in attention moving such as AoI sequence, 
                              AoI hit, and dwell time. However, it is not easy to understand how visual stimuli affect gaze movements 
                              and analyze gaze behavior patterns within the AoI. Therefore, visual saliency and the gazed object are 
                              used as a clue to infer gaze behavior.
                              <br>
                              This thesis studies continuous eye movement characteristics and proposes novel gaze data visualizations 
                              to understand human visual attention. The discovered eye movement characteristics are utilized in data 
                              processing for identification gaze behavior and gaze data visualization design. We propose abstract gaze 
                              data visualization using the smudge effect to understand the flow of visual attention and saliency-based 
                              gaze data visualization to provide visual saliency as overt clues on gaze behavior analysis. Also, this 
                              thesis discusses gazed objects, the context meaning of stimulus, on the understanding of human visual 
                              attention and suggests directions for future research.
