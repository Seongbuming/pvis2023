                           <p>The PacificVis Storytelling Contest celebrates its seventh year in 2023. This contest aims to encourage students, researchers, 
                              and visualization practitioners to demonstrate the value of data visualization through compelling visual data stories and to promote 
                              innovative and effective use of data visualization for communication and presentation.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This contest explores the emerging data communication genre, including data storytelling, narrative visualizations, explanatory notebooks, and visual essays. 
                              Potential contest entrants are encouraged to review the following events and venues for inspiration.

                           <p>
                              PacificVis is a unified visualization symposium welcoming all areas of visualization, such as information, scientific, graph, security, 
                              and software visualization. Storytellers are invited to submit visual data-driven stories that draw upon any of these areas. 
                              In addition, entries that focus on computational journalism and artistic design projects are encouraged. 
                              Unlike contests such as the <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/">IEEE VAST challenge</a> or 
                              the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/projects/sciviscontest2022/">IEEE SciVis Contest</a>, the data for the PacificVis visual data storytelling contest 
                              is intentionally left unspecified; storytellers are free to choose any publicly available dataset(s). 
                              Similarly, the task that storytellers are to accomplish is to successfully communicate a message or series of messages 
                              (i.e., a narrative, a series of insights) using data visualization techniques. The story's themes can draw from any topic, 
                              including current affairs, history, natural disasters, and research findings from the sciences and humanities.
                           </p>

                           <p>
                              Entries may be submitted by teams or individuals from industry and academia. Conference sponsors can 
                              participate non-competitively. Submissions must fulfill the requirements explained below.
                           </p>

                           <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
                           <p>Submissions can take several forms: </p>

                           <ul>
                              <li><b>Images: </b>A collection of images, charts, infographics, data comics, and/or data visualization that convey a story using 
                                 engaging visual designs. <a href="https://vimeo.com/422255493">Example 1</a> and <a href="https://aviz.fr/~bbach/datacomics/">
                                    Example 2</a>.</li>
                              <li><b>Video: </b>An animation that tells a data-driven story using visualizations. Note that video submissions that appear to be 
                                 tutorials or demonstrations of a visualization tool will not be considered; the focus of the submission must be a visual narrative 
                                 about the data, not a visualization tool or technique. <a href="https://vimeo.com/220376839">Example</a>.</li>
                              <li><b>Notebooks: </b>Interactive articles, markups, and notebooks that guide the reader through a narrative using text and visualizations. 
                                 Examples of explainable notebook platforms include <a href="https://distill.pub/">Distill</a>, 
                                 <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/">Idyll</a>, and <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable.</a></li>
                              <li><b>Website: </b>An interactive web page that guides the user through the story. Note that purely analytic or exploratory 
                                 visualization tools/dashboards that do not provide guidance or storytelling to the user will not be considered. 
                                 The winning entry in the 2017 contest is an excellent example of a website entry: 
                                 <a href="http://pacificvis.snu.ac.kr/programs/contest-108">Example</a>.</li>
                              <li><b>Unconventional Forms: </b>Other forms of interactive storytelling work, such as virtual/augmented reality, mixed reality, 
                                 and other audio-visual projects, are also encouraged to submit as well. A video is likely the best way to make the initial submission. 
                                 For unconventional entries that are accepted, we will work with the artists/authors to decide the best possible way to exhibit the work 
                                 at the conference.</li>
                           </ul>

                           <p>Other requirements:</p>

                           <ul>
                              <li>The story must feature a visual representation of data generated by various techniques such as computer programming (e.g., D3.js), 
                                 manual illustration (e.g., using pen & paper, physical objects, or illustration software), or other relevant techniques. 
                                 Third-party techniques or applications may be used in conjunction with the author's own work as long as proper credit is given to their 
                                 respective creators and it is made clear which aspects of the implementation represent the authors' own work.</li>
                              <li>The entries must be original data-driven stories that have not been previously published elsewhere.</li>
                              <li>The dataset(s) used in the story must be publicly available, and linked to, sourced, or otherwise referenced.</li>
                              <li>The story content can be in any language, while accompanying explanations should be provided in English. This will help our judges 
                                 provide a proper evaluation of your submission.</li>
                              <li>A 150-word abstract (entered on the PCS submission website) that may briefly describe the purpose of the story along with the data 
                                 analysis and design process undertaken by the storyteller(s). The abstract should not include the message(s) communicated by the story; 
                                 the story must stand alone in this regard such that a viewer should not need to read the abstract to understand the story.</li>
                              <li>Supplementary materials are encouraged. For example, high-resolution images, videos, audio files, or other materials to show design 
                                 processes that will help reviewers evaluate the submission.</li>
                              <li>
                                 For the accepted entries, we expect the following additional requirements:
                                 <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                    <li>A brief demo video describing the submission. (Exact details will be sent out to accepted entries.)</li>
                                    <li>At least one member of the team must register for the conference and be present at the contest's sessions and award ceremony.</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </li>
                           </ul>

                              <li>Is the story original  (i.e., the author’s own work not previously published elsewhere)?</li>
                              <li>Is the story trustworthy and functional (i.e., is the message clearly communicated)?</li>
