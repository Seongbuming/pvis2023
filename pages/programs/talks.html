                              This talk will overview interactive data visualization research with a focus on the development and 
                              use of visualization techniques for explainable and trustworthy machine learning. As supervised and 
                              unsupervised machine learning are both considered as complex and their internal operations are mostly 
                              hidden in black boxes, it becomes difficult for model developers but also for analysts to assess and 
                              trust their results. Moreover, choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms or setting hyperparameters 
                              are further challenges where the human in the loop is necessary. I will exemplify solutions of some of 
                              these challenges with the help of a selection of visualization showcases recently developed by the iVis 
                              research group at Linköping University and the ISOVIS research group at Linnaeus University, Sweden. 
                              Our visual analytics examples range from the visual exploration of the most performant and most diverse 
                              models for the creation of stacking ensembles, the use of multiple embeddings for data analysis and 
                              visualization, to ideas of making the black boxes of complex dimensionality reduction techniques more 
                              transparent in order to increase the trust into their results. Moreover, I will highlight the most 
                              recent analytical results of our state-of-the-art reports on visualization for enhancing trust into 
                              machine learning and the use of embeddings in visual analytics. My talk will conclude with a discussion 
                              of the most important trends and challenges in VIS4AI and AI4VIS. All together I hope that this talk 
                              can serve as a starting point for further discussions during the PacificVis 2023 Visualization Meets 
                              AI Workshop.

                              Visualization Meets AI for Future Mobility

                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              <br>
                              As mobility systems comprise important societal infrastructure that is directly relevant to our lives, 
                              system inefficiency can cause stressful situations and waste societal resources. For example, sudden 
                              traffic congestion affects drivers not only on the congested road but also on adjacent roads due to 
                              congestion propagation. Likewise, ineffective geographical distribution of taxis in a city can increase 
                              passenger wait times and waste resources. In this talk, I present how visualization can support mobility 
                              system experts. First, I introduce a visual analytics system that allows a city’s traffic control experts 
                              to analyze, monitor, and predict future traffic speeds at work. To accurately predict the future traffic 
                              conditions of a city’s road network, it is important to understand the behaviors of AI models. From this 
                              perspective, I describe how a visualization system can help people explore the behaviors of a deep 
                              learning model and utilize the analysis results for proving improved navigation services. Lastly, 
                              I discuss important tasks in the mobility domain, such as mobility-on-demand, that are underexplored 
                              via visualization.
