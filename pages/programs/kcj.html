                              Music is a typical content that is worth to be visualized. There have been two types of topics on music 
                              visualization: visualization of the features or the structure of a single work, and visualization of 
                              the distributions of a music collection. We can immediately understand the overall structure and 
                              distribution of music by using visualizations while we need to take a time to listen to them. This talk 
                              introduces typical studies on music visualization and then the speaker’s own recent studies on music 
                              visualization.

                              An exemplar is an entity that represents a desirable instance in a multi-attribute configuration space. It offers certain strengths in some of its 
                              attributes without unduly compromising the strengths in other attributes. Exemplars are frequently sought after in real life applications, 
                              such as systems engineering, investment banking, drug advisory, product marketing and many others. However, effective identifying the exemplar 
                              in multi-attribute configuration spaces brings lots of challenge due to the high dimensionality and intricate relations inside the data.
                              <br>
                              In this talk, I will introduce a novel method for exemplar identification in multi-attribute configuration spaces based on the contextual 
                              visualizations that produces a 2D embedding where users can view the data objects in the context of the data attributes. Then, certain graphical 
                              enhancements are generated to help gain a better understanding of the attribute-wise tradeoffs and so select better exemplar sets. Three different 
                              graphical designs, namely iso-contour, value-shaded topographic rendering and terrain topographic rendering, are proposed and compared with a 
                              baseline DCM display with efficiently user studies.

                              Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to increased interest in leveraging these models to enhance human-AI collaboration in 
                              visual analytics. LLMs provide a common language between humans and machines, facilitating communication and collaboration in visual analytics 
                              workflows. They can also help bridge knowledge gaps between different stakeholders and enable more effective sharing of insights and recommendations.

                              In this talk, I will explore the benefits and challenges of integrating LLMs into visual analytics systems. I will discuss how LLMs can improve
                               natural language understanding, enabling more personalized insights and recommendations. I will also discuss some examples of implementations of 
                               LLMs in visual analytics, including their use in generating natural language explanations and summaries of data, facilitating interactive and 
                               conversational interfaces, and identifying hidden trends and anomalies in the data.

                              Machine learning technology continues to develop rapidly, and in some fields, high-performance models 
                              have been created that make fewer errors than humans. On the other hand, it has also been shown that 
                              human adjustments effectively improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It is significant for 
                              model creators and users to be able to understand the internals and behavior of models, and visualization 
                              for model characteristics or the flow of tunings is useful. This presentation introduces visualization

                              Solutions of the heat equation are obtained in a form of combined kernel polynomials. They possibly 
                              provide a series of non-Gaussian behaviors, which observed in many cases. The equation also carries 
                              many solutions under given boundary conditions. It shows the (information) flows, and they work as a 
                              ground to how to interpret the causality in a network. The entropy borne from these solutions is also 
                              computed and it shows the deviation from the Gaussian one.
