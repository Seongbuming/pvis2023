                              Dr. Jinah Park is a Professor in the School of Computing, and ICT Endowed Chair Professor of 
                              the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). She received a BSE in Electrical 
                              Engineering from Columbia University in New York, and an MSE and a Ph.D. in Computer and Information 
                              Science from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She is currently leading Computer Graphics 
                              and Visualization research lab at KAIST. Her major academic contributions are to the field of medical 
                              imaging, where she developed a computational technique for analyzing 3D cardiac motion from MR tagging 
                              data. Her recent work on the deformable models for morphometric study applied to aging brain structures 
                              was selected as KAIST’s Top 10 Research Achievements. Her research team is also interested in understanding 
                              3D interaction behaviors in a VR environment while developing various haptic rendering algorithms applied 
                              to virtual simulation. She is serving as Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Haptics, and she is also 
                              General Co-Chair of MICCAI 2025 to be held in Korea.
